🏠 Boston Housing Data Analysis

📋 Project Overview
Statistical analysis of the Boston Housing Dataset to identify key factors influencing median home values using hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.

🔍 Key Findings
✅ Proximity to Charles River
Significant impact on home values (p < 0.05)
Homes near the river have higher median values

✅ Property Age Groups
Strong statistical difference in values across age categories (p ≈ 1.71e-15)
Property age significantly influences home prices

✅ Pollution & Business Correlation
Strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.76, p ≈ 7.91e-98)
Higher non-retail business acreage correlates with increased nitric oxide concentrations

✅ Employment Center Distance
Significant positive relationship with home values (p < 0.05)
Each unit increase in distance increases median home value by ≈$1,092

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, seaborn, matplotlib)
Statistical Methods: t-tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis, OLS regression
